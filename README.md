\# Markdown Presentations

Since \`0.19.0\`, Zettlr supports exporting presentations using both the \`reveal.js\`-framework and \`pandoc\`.

\*\*\*

\## MD + Zettlr + \`reveal.js\` = â¤ï¸

Creating presentations using Zettlr is simple: Each slide is begun by a header level 1. Any text afterwards will become the slide's content.

\*\*\*

But using a line divider ("`***`" or `---`) is also permitted. This lets you have more space on your slide.

\*\*\*

\## Smaller headings

This can also be used to make headings smaller, if you don't like the big level-1-headings.

\*\*\*

\## Control the presentation

You can control the presentation with the keyboard:

\- \`F\` enters the fullscreen
\- `.` blacks out the slide
\- `?` shows additional shortcuts.

\*\*\*

\## Markdown elements

All elements that you might use in markdown are permitted in these slides as well.
